# Virtual Network Threat Detection

Welcome to the **Virtual Network Threat Detection** documentation.

This project provides a **container-based virtual lab** for experimenting with
network threat detection techniques using modern open-source tools.

# Deployment

This section explains how to deploy and run the lab environment.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

The environment is deployed using:

- Containerlab
- Docker
- Predefined topology files

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Docker installed
- Containerlab installed
- Sufficient system resources

---

## ▶️ Basic Workflow

```bash
git clone <repository>
cd virtual-network-threat-detection
containerlab deploy
```

---

## 🧹 Cleanup

To destroy the lab:

```bash
containerlab destroy
```

!!! important
    Always clean up resources after testing to avoid conflicts.

# Architecture

This page describes the **high-level architecture** of the Virtual Network Threat Detection lab.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The lab is composed of multiple containers connected through a virtual network.
Traffic flows through monitoring points where detection tools inspect packets.

---

## 🔁 Traffic Flow

1. Client generates traffic
2. Traffic traverses routing components
3. IDS sensors analyze packets
4. Logs and alerts are generated

---

## 🧩 Core Components

### Network Layer
- Virtual links
- Isolated subnets
- Routing elements

### Detection Layer
- Passive monitoring
- Inline inspection (optional)
- Alert generation

---

## 📐 Design Principles

- **Reproducibility**
- **Modularity**
- **Minimal manual configuration**

!!! note
    The architecture is intentionally simple to make experimentation easier.

# Basic Lab Topology

This page documents the **basic topology** used as a starting point for experiments.

---

## 🧪 Purpose of this Topology

The basic lab is designed to:

- Validate connectivity
- Test IDS visibility
- Generate controlled traffic

---

## 🗺️ Topology Description

The topology consists of:

- One client node
- One server node
- One monitoring node

Traffic flows from client to server while being observed by the IDS.

---

## 🔌 Nodes Overview

| Node | Role |
|-----|------|
| Client | Generates traffic |
| Router | Forwards packets |
| Sensor | Inspects traffic |

---

## 🛠️ Usage

This topology is ideal for:

- Initial setup validation
- Rule testing
- Learning traffic inspection basics

!!! warning
    This topology is **not** meant to simulate production networks.


--------

# Suricata

Suricata is used as the **primary intrusion detection system** in this lab.

---

## 🛡️ What is Suricata?

Suricata is a high-performance IDS/IPS capable of:

- Signature-based detection
- Protocol analysis
- File extraction

---

## ⚙️ How it is used in this lab

Suricata runs as a container connected to a monitoring interface.

Key characteristics:

- Passive IDS mode
- Custom rule sets
- JSON log output

---

## 📂 Outputs

Suricata generates:

- Alerts
- Flow logs
- Statistics

```text
alert.signature
alert.severity
flow.bytes
```
!!! tip
    Start with a small rule set to avoid alert noise.
